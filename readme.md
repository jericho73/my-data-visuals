# Some of my Data Visuals

I've listed several Power BI dashboards along with their corresponding datasets below. Each dataset is available in the "Datasets" directory within this repository.

#### HR Dashboard

This dataset contained transaction information on item purchases from a bakery for six month period in late 2016 and early 2017. I only use the 2017 data to construct a simple dashboard showing us the top item sold from the bakery, the frequency of transaction concerning the time of the day, the total transactions per week in 2017, and a leaderboard of the most common item baskets we see our customer's purchase. This is a really simple dashboard that can be made if you have market basket data with time series information.

#### Investor Report

This dataset contained the volume, market cap, and opening/closing prices of every cryptocurrency coin on a daily basis. The group of visualization above shows the lead-up and the aftermath of the early 2018 crypto currently bubble. We can see a general increase in the number of coins offered on the market before the crash, and a slight reduction after prices started dropping rapidly.


#### Project Progress Tracking

This dataset logs major terrorist attacks across the world. The dataset can tell us the number deaths, wounded, and locations of each terror attack. The visualization above shows the death toll from these attacks per country as an interactive map in Tableau.
